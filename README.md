# ME-781-project

## Aim of the project
To solve the problem of creditors on whether to give out a loan or not based on the prediction by ML model that whether someone will default or not

## How we are solving the problem?
With the advancement of technology, we have starting trusting machines and codes more than human promises. On these terms, using Machine learning we tried to figure out how the credit-risk depends on the various information about the user and then analysing it through vaious ML models.

## Execution of the project
### The project is done in 2 parts:
#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
Here we analysed each parameter, their correlation with other parameters. Various graphs have been plotted pertaining to the usefulness of each parameter. Box plots show the distribution of each parameter; violin plots show how realated are 2 parameters. Based on these plots and correlations; we tried to figure out which are the most useful parameters to detect whether a person will default or not.
